# Photo Location Website

Hello lovely people!

I've had the idea of creating a website which makes it easy to find great spots for taking photos for a while now. Instagram has the option to compile photos based off location but it's hard to find things based off your current location. This project has four main components:

1. Search for photo spots based off your location
2. Highlight great shots based off category
3. Submit great shots based off category
4. Ability for user's to vote for their favorite photos

My goal for this project is to help improve my coding skills as well as documenting this project so others can utilizing my guide as a starting point for their own projects.

With Love,<br>
Prav
